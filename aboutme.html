        <p>I recently received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at George Mason University.  
            During my time in school, I have been participating in hackathons, pursuing internships such as my Winter Internship at Mastercard, 
            and being a board member of my university's Anime and Gaming Club.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Most of my programming language experience is with Java but I also
            have worked with Python, HTML & CSS, and Javascript.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I am currently looking for entry-level positions in QA Testing, Database Management, and Full-Stack
